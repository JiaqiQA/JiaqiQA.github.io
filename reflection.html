				<h2>Responsive Design's concept, advantage, and more</h2>
				<p>
					Responsive Web Design is a concept of web app design which suggests that the design and development of 
					the webpage (or app) should respond to the user's environment or behavior, based on device screen size,
					platform and screen orientation. By this approach, a website can self adjust its layout to fit in different
					screen size so the user can have the best browsing experience.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					In web development industry, Responsive Design becomes the best solution by providing web developers
					a way to accommodate the ever-growing variety of devices and screens types efficiently. Web app that
					follow Responsive Design concepts can responds automatically and optimally to the user's preference, 
					regardless of the choice of screen and software. It not only reduces developer's effort to design pages
					explicitly to accommodate different needs, but also make maintaining web app a lot easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					The technologies and techniques I have used in my Responsive web design are: viewport, with self detected
					screen width, different section of class separated base on screen size (max-device-width) in one single 
					CSS files, and @media concepts in CSS file.    
				</p>
				<p>
					I have learned that using Responsive Design in web app development is necessary nowadays because modern
					hardware with variety of screen size, behavior, and usage make accommodating to user's preference becomes
					important.
